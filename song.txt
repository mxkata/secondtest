I guess you never really know yourself
Because I've never been the kind to ask for help
I'm begging for this, I'm begging for this
Alleviation from all of the ugly shit

Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me up

There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again

There's a thousand voices in my head
I just hope it doesn't take a rope around my neck
To put them all to rest
I wanna feel love, I wanna feel love again

Yeah, come on
Yeah, come on
